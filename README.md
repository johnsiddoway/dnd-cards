# dnd-cards
Monster and NPC stat cards for D&amp;D 5e, using examples from the 5E System Reference Document: https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd.

The goal of this repository is to provide a simple CSS framework to allow for printing content for personal use in offline D&D games.
